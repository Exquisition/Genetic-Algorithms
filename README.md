# Genetic-Algorithms
attempts at implementing simple applications of genetic algorithms

The five main phases in any Genetic Algorithm are:


## 1. Initial population

Form a population of valid solutions to evolve from

## 2. Fitness function

Evaluates the fitness of members within a population. The fitness quantitatively measures how good of a solution to the problem each member is.

## 3. Selection

Selects those members with a high enough fitness value to evolve.

## 4. Crossover

Performs genetic crossover between the pairs of chosen parents to produce offspring.

## 5. Mutation
To further evolution of members into good solutions. Crossover alone isn't enough to cause sufficent momentum.
